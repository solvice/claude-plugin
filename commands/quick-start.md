## Quick Start

1. Call `vrp-demo` to generate and solve a sample routing problem
2. Show the route map with `vrp-get-solution`
3. Summarize what was solved: how many jobs, how many routes, the score, total travel time
4. Ask what the user wants to explore next: scoring, what-if analysis, or building their own request
